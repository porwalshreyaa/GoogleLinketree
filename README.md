# GoogleLinketree
A Google Search that also contains links to my social accounts (in progress)

I plan to create a cool, Google formation clone that works like linktree for me.
<br>
You click on Twitter-> It'll take you to my Twitter handle
<br>
You click Linkedin-> It'll take you to my Linkedin handle
<br>
And you click Gmail, it'll open an email template to contact me...
<br>
But it'll also show you results for what you search in the search bar...
<br>
I made an initial version... [Click here to see my progress](https://porwalshreyaa.github.io/GoogleLinketree/Google.html)
