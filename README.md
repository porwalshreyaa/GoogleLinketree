# GoogleLinketree
A Google Search that also contains links to my social accounts (in progress)

I plan to create a cool, Google formation clone that works like linktree for me.
You click on Twitter-> It'll take you to my Twitter handle
You click Linkedin-> It'll take you to my Linkedin handle
And you click Gmail, it'll open an email template to contact me... 
But it'll also show you results for what you search in the search bar...
I made an initial version...[Click here to see my progress](https://porwalshreyaa.github.io/GoogleLinketree/Google.html)
